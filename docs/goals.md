# Program Goals

## Primary Goals

### 1. Team Enablement

**Objective:** Equip every engineering team with the knowledge, tools, and confidence to build effectively on the Viam platform.

**Success Criteria:**
- Every engineer has completed at least one project on the platform
- Teams can independently start and complete projects without external support
- Reduction in "how do I do X?" questions in Slack/support channels
- Engineers can articulate Viam's core value propositions

### 2. Individual & Team Ownership of the Platform

**Objective:** Foster a culture where engineers feel personal ownership over the platform's success and quality.

**Success Criteria:**
- Engineers proactively identify and report platform issues
- Engineers contribute fixes and improvements beyond their assigned tasks
- Increased participation in platform discussions and design reviews
- Engineers advocate for the platform in customer and community interactions

### 3. Platform Quality

**Objective:** Improve platform quality through direct, hands-on experience building real applications.

**Success Criteria:**
- Decrease in customer-reported bugs
- Increase in internally-discovered issues before release
- Documentation improvements driven by real usage
- Reduction in time-to-first-working-application for new users

## Secondary Goals

### Developer Experience Improvement

By having engineers use the platform daily, we will:
- Identify friction points in the developer experience
- Surface missing documentation and examples
- Find gaps in tooling and debugging capabilities
- Validate that our APIs are intuitive and well-designed

### Knowledge Sharing

- Build institutional knowledge about building robotics applications
- Create a library of example applications and patterns
- Develop internal experts who can support customer implementations

### Morale & Engagement

- Give engineers tangible projects to be proud of
- Create opportunities for cross-team collaboration
- Celebrate visible accomplishments through demos and recognition

## Measuring Success

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Engineers actively building | TBD | 100% |
| Hackathon project continuation (Mar 1) | N/A | 70% |
| Platform bugs discovered internally | TBD | +50% |
| Time from bug discovery to fix | TBD | -30% |

### Qualitative Indicators

- Engineers express enthusiasm about building on the platform
- Quality of internal demos improves over time
- Teams voluntarily expand scope of their projects
- Engineers request to continue projects beyond initial scope
