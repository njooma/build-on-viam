# Project Submission Guidelines

## Who Can Submit

Any Viam engineer can propose a project idea for the Build on Viam program.

## Submission Process

### 1. Prepare Your Proposal

Use the [project template](../templates/project-template.md) to document your idea. At minimum, your proposal must include:

- Clear project description
- List of Viam capabilities it will demonstrate
- Hardware requirements (if any)
- MVP scope that can be completed during the hackathon
- Post-hackathon backlog items

### 2. Submit for Review

1. Create a new file in the `projects/` directory using the template
2. Name your file: `[project-name].md` (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
3. Submit a PR to this repository
4. Tag Shannon and Avery for review

### 3. Review Criteria

Projects will be evaluated on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Platform Coverage | High | Does it showcase meaningful Viam capabilities? |
| Feasibility | High | Can MVP be achieved in 3 days? Is the backlog realistic? |
| Visibility | Medium | Will this make a compelling demo? |
| Team Interest | Medium | Will engineers want to work on this? |
| Resource Requirements | Medium | Is hardware available? Is it remote-friendly? |

### 4. Approval

- Proposals reviewed within 1 week of submission
- Feedback provided if changes needed
- Approved projects added to the official project list

## Project Requirements

### Must Have

- **Demonstrates Viam value:** Project should showcase at least 2 Viam capabilities
- **Scoped MVP:** A working demo achievable in 3 days
- **Defined backlog:** Clear post-hackathon work items
- **Documentation plan:** Commitment to document the build process

### Nice to Have

- Remote-friendly (can be developed without physical hardware)
- Showcases fleet or scale capabilities
- Builds on existing Viam examples or tutorials
- Has customer or marketing visibility potential

### Avoid

- Projects that only use Viam for trivial functionality
- Scope so large that MVP is unrealistic
- Projects requiring unavailable or expensive hardware
- Ideas that duplicate existing projects without adding value

## Example Good Submissions

**Good:** "Autonomous inventory scanner - a mobile robot that navigates a warehouse, uses vision ML to identify products, and syncs inventory data to the cloud"
- Multiple capabilities: navigation, vision, data, cloud
- Clear demo potential
- Defined scope

**Less Good:** "Robot that blinks an LED"
- Too simple
- Doesn't showcase meaningful Viam capabilities
- Limited learning opportunity
