# Build on Viam FAQ

## Participation & Time

**How much time should I dedicate to this program?**

At least 4 hours per week.

**Is participation mandatory?**

Yes. Knowing the Viam platform is a core expectation of performance at Viam. Ongoing hands-on usage and continuous learning are required to be effective in our roles.
